                    Trees helps to clean the air, soil and water, making the earth a beautiful livable place. Living close to trees makes us healthier and happier. Its time to SAVE Trees, protect forests and spread awareness. If you want to save trees, you can help by protecting those that grow around your home, and planting more Trees. 
                    Trees produces oxygen that is life line of all living beings. In the hot summer we usually plan trips in the hilly areas. But if the rate of cutting Trees remains same then we don’t have enough Trees to plan a trip, seasonal raining and amount of fresh oxygen will no longer be available.
