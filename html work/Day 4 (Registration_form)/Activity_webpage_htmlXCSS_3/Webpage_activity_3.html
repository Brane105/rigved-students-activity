    <p>Trees are the beautiful creation of Mother Nature and saving trees is one of the primary responsibilities of human beings. Saving trees means saving your own life for one more day. People nowadays barely care about the source of oxygen, but trees are the only one to provide oxygen. They are a peaceful expression of scenery and life. Along with being a mother and home to so many birds and animals, trees are also meant to satisfy human needs by providing oxygen, and definitely not wood.
    Destructing trees may give you luxury living experience, but the lavish life will not help if you don’t have oxygen to breathe in your coming days. People should understand the importance of saving trees and should make this environment a better place for living. We have to stop chopping trees as soon as possible, without looking to the purpose. While no one understands the drawbacks of cutting trees, it must be noticed that cutting trees will lead to a high concentration of CO2 which is carbon dioxide-the greenhouse gas.
